# 1. Problem 
The purpose of this benchmark is to evaluate the performance on the 19x19 version of the board game Go.  While inspired by DeepMind's AlphaGo algorithm, this project is not a DeepMind project nor is it affiliated with the official AlphaGo project.  The Go engine to be evaluated here is based on a fork of Minigo, which uses self-play reinforcement learning to play against itself and improve its performance.  Unlike some of its predecessors, this type of Go engine does not require any supervisory knowledge from human experts.

### Steps to download and verify data
Unlike other benchmarks, there is no data to download. All training data comes from games played during benchmarking.

### Steps to run and time

To run, this assumes you checked out the repo into $HOME, adjust paths as necessary.

    cd ~/reference/reinforcement/tensorflow/
    IMAGE=`sudo docker build . | tail -n 1 | awk '{print $3}'`
    SEED=1
    NOW=`date "+%F-%T"`
    sudo docker run --runtime=nvidia -t -i $IMAGE "./run_and_time.sh" $SEED | tee benchmark-$NOW.log
    
To change the quality target, modify 'params/final.json' and set the field 'TERMINATION_ACCURACY' to be '0.10' for about a 10 hour runtime, or '0.03' for about a 3 hour runtime. Note that you will have to rebuild the docker after modifying 'params/final.json'.

### Tunable hyperparameters

The following flags are allowed to be modified by entrants:
Flags that do not directly affect convergence:
 - _all flags related to file paths & device IDs_
 - `bool_features`
 - `input_layout`
 - `summary_steps`
 - `cache_size_mb`
 - `num_read_threads`
 - `num_write_threads`
 - `output_threads`
 - `selfplay_threads`
 - `parallel_search`
 - `parallel_inference`
 - `concurrent_games_per_thread`
 - `validate`
 - `holdout_pct`

Flags that directly affect convergence:
 - `train_batch_size`
 - `lr_rates`
 - `lr_boundaries`

Entrants are also free to replace the code responsible for writing, shuffling
and sampling training examples with equivalent functionality (e.g. replacing the
use of `sample_records` and a file system with a different storage solution).

# 3. Model
The seminal work on AlphaGo [1] showed that the combination supervised learning (guided by human expert games) with self-play based reinforcement learning could result in a system capable of defeating professional players. In follow-up work, AlphaGo Zero was introduced [2], which abandoned the requirement for supervised learning and relied purely on self-play reinforcement learning to achieve superhuman performance. 

This benchmark does not use AlphaGo Zero directly, but rather is based on a fork of the Minigo project (https://github.com/tensorflow/minigo). Minigo is a compact Go engine that is modeled after and inspired by AlphaGo Zero.

### Reinforcement Setup

This benchmark includes both the environment and training for 19x19 Go. There are four primary phases in this benchmark, these phases are repeated in order:

 - Selfplay: the *current best* model plays games against itself to produce board positions for training.
 - Training: train the neural networks selfplay data from several recent models. 
 - Target Evaluation: the termination criteria for the benchmark is checked using the provided record of professional games. 
 - Model Evaluation: the *current best* and the most recently trained model play a series of games. In order to become the new *current best*, the most recently trained model must win 55% of the games.

### Structure

This task has a non-trivial network structure, including a search tree. A good overview of the structure can be found here: https://medium.com/applied-data-science/alphago-zero-explained-in-one-diagram-365f5abf67e0. 

### Weight and bias initialization and Loss Function
Network weights are initialized randomly. Initialization and loss are described here;
["Mastering the Game of Go with Deep Neural Networks and Tree Search"](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961)

### Optimizer
We use a MomentumOptimizer to train the primary network. 

# 4. Quality

Due to the difficulty of training a highly proficient go model, our quality metric and termination criteria is based on predicting moves from human reference games. Currently published results indicate that it takes weeks of time and/or cluster sized resources to achieve a high level of play. Given more limited time and resources, it is possible to predict a significant number of moves from professional or near-professional games. 

### Quality metric

Provided in with this benchmark are records of human games and the quality metric is the percent of the time the model chooses the same move the human chose in each position. Each position is attempted twice by the model (keep in mind the model's choice is non-deterministic). The metric is calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the number of predictions attempted. 

The particular games we use are from Iyama Yuta 6 Title Celebration, between contestants Murakawa Daisuke, Sakai Hideyuki, Yamada Kimio, Hyakuta Naoki, Yuki Satoshi, and Iyama Yuta.



### Quality target
The quality target is predicting 40% of the moves.

### Quality Progression
Informally, we have observed that quality should improve roughly linearly with time. We observed roughly 0.5% improvement in quality per hour of runtime. An example of approximately how we've seen quality progress over time:

    Approx. Hours to Quality (16 CPU & 1 P100)
    2h           3%
    12h          14%
    24h          19%
    36h          24%
    60h          34%

Note that quality does not necessarily monotonically increase. 

### Evaluation frequency
Evaluation should be preformed for every model which is trained (regardless if it wins the "model evaluation" round). 
    

### Evaluation thoroughness
All positions should be considered in each evaluation phase.
